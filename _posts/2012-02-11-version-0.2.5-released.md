# Version 0.2.5 Released

**February 11th, 2012**

It's been quite a long time since I've given Hayfever any serious attention. I glossed over a quick 0.2.4 release a little while ago, but otherwise there haven't been any releases for about 8 months. I know that it's not cool to leave a project in the dark for that long, but I choose to think of it a little differently. _Hayfever's been running on over 300 people's browsers for 8 months without a single complaint or bug report._ I think that's pretty amazing.

Anyway, I've started working on Hayfever again because I realized that I'm never going to have "enough" free time. I just have to make the best of the free time I have and make Hayfever the best Chrome extension it can possibly be.

## Version 0.2.5 Changelog

* Hayfever's badge now blinks when a timer is running. You need to go into options and turn this feature on if you're a current user.
* Upgraded to jQuery 1.7.1
* Made the popup a little wider, mostly to facilitate taking screenshots for the Chrome Web Store. They're very picky about dimensions.

That's it. Look for more releases in the near future.
