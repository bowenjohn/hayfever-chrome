# Version 0.2.2 Released

**April 23, 2011**

I've just published Hayfever v0.2.2 to the Chrome Web Store. This release includes several UI refinements and bug-fixes:

## Version 0.2.2 Changelog

* Added more robust refresh behavior. All refreshes now poll the API for the absolute latest changes. The popup auto-refreshes when it opens and whenever a timer is created, deleted, edited, started or stopped. ([GitHub Issue #16](https://github.com/mikedamage/hayfever-chrome/issues/16))
* The plugin now tells the user whether API authentication was successful or not, and displays a link to the options page to correct the problem. ([GitHub Issue #9](https://github.com/mikedamage/hayfever-chrome/issues/9))
* Removed the spinner animated GIF for running timers. Running timers are now marked by a pulsing green background (CSS animation). ([GitHub Issue #14](https://github.com/mikedamage/hayfever-chrome/issues/14))
* Added checkbox on Options page to display task notes in timesheet entries. ([GitHub Issue #4](https://github.com/mikedamage/hayfever-chrome/issues/4))
* Changed timer option links from text to icons.
