# Version 0.2.3 Released

**June 7th, 2011**

So I've been buried in work for the last couple months and haven't had much time for Hayfever, but Harvest contacted me today about some improvements to their API. Thus, version 0.2.3 was born!

Before I get into the short list of changes in this release, let me take this opportunity to beg the public for assistance: 

## Help Wanted

I have a lot of ideas, but very little time. If anybody's interested in helping out, check the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mikedamage/hayfever-chrome/issues), fork the project, and scratch an itch. Pull Requests are welcome!

_Now back to your regularly scheduled changelog..._

## Version 0.2.3 Changelog

* Stopped setting `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers in Harvest API requests.
* Added `.json` to the end of all Harvest API URLs.

The Harvest API just got a little smarter, so Hayfever doesn't have to do as much work. If you have any problems with this release, please [report them](https://github.com/mikedamage/hayfever-chrome/issues)!

Big thanks to Harvest for contacting me about this. Makes me feel pretty darn important.
