## Summary

Hayfever is a plugin for Google Chrome that lets you manage your [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com) timers and timesheets.

Hayfever currently duplicates the feature set of the Harvest desktop widget, but I've got plans to extend its functionality far beyond that.

It's currently in private beta on the Chrome Web Store, but you can download it and install it on your own via the Downloads link above.

### Stuff Hayfever Can Do

Hayfever can currently:

* Authenticate w/ Harvest time tracking API
* Display a badge with total hours worked today
* Display a list of existing timers
* Start and stop existing timers
* Create new timers
* Edit and update existing timers

## Installation Instructions

If you've read through all the disclaimers and still wanna give Hayfever a try in its current raw state - that's great! I use it every day in my work and thus far it works pretty well.

If you're not one of the lucky few who got onto my Web Store testers list, don't despair! Google only lets me have 255 characters worth of beta tester email addresses, but you can still download the plugin as a CRX file bundled by yours truly.

1. Click the downloads link above and grab the most recent CRX file.
2. Open it in Chrome.
3. Install it, then right-click on the Hayfever icon in your toolbar.
4. Fill in your Harvest subdomain, username, and password.
	* Please consider allowing me to gather usage statistics! I'm a privacy nut, so I turned this off by default, but it would definitely help me to understand my users.
5. Use Hayfever!

## Usage Statistics

Hayfever gathers usage statistics via Google Analytics, but only if you decide to let it. Right now I do __not__ do any event tracking, so the only data I get is how many people use the plugin and how often.

Analytics are turned off by default because I believe it should be a matter of choice.
